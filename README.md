# textutils
Golang CLI textutils, little project of mine, still very WIP! Creating a bunch of CLI textutils to ease text file handling on the command line. On the list:

* fields: split lines into fields and arrange them back together
* randomize: reverse of sort
* lines: like cut for lines, but then easier
